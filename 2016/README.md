## Which days I used help
- Day 1 Part 1 (Embarrassing I know!).  Used https://github.com/rasbt/advent-of-code-2016/blob/master/python_code/aoc_01_01.py to work out solution.  Problem with my code was that I did not take full input of numbers. 
- Day 1 Part 2 needed help to work out how the example worked
